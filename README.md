A simple scripting language with JFlex and CUP.

Compatible with Java 17.

Requires JFlex 1.9.1 and CUP 1.1 to work. Make sure JFlex is installed and the "jflex" command works in the terminal.
Also make sure to add .jar files from CUP in a special "lib" folder (path of "lib" relative to the project's root folder).
